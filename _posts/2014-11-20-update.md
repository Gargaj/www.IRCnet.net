Several things happened this year:

* The `ircnet.choopa.net` open server delinked

* The xs4all servers and webchat delinked.

* `irc.ca.ircnet.net`, an open server in canada, linked

* America has its own hub now.

While it's sad to see xs4all and choopa leave us, I'm happy to see there have
been improvements to the US part of the network so in case there's another
split between europe and the US, the US part of the network should also be
stable.

What have you been doing?

What do you want this site to be? Do you think resurrecting the IRCnet forum
would be a good idea? Let us know!
